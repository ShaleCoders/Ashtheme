As of version 2.2, Services no longer supports SQL databases. To use 
Services 2.2 or newer, you will need to switch to the flatfile backend.

The information on how to use the SQL backend has been removed as
versions prior to 2.2 are extremely unsupported by Atheme and it
is highly recommended to upgrade. The information on how to switch
to a SQL backend (and vice-versa) is still left in this file in case
you are upgrading from a old version to a newer version.

If you would like web integration with your Atheme Services setup,
it is highly recommended to use the XML-RPC interface which also
happens to be "live".


Switching to a SQL backend
--------------------------

Switching to a SQL backend is relatively painless; just make sure
that your database {} block is configured properly.
  Hint: /msg operserv rehash

Once you have a properly configured database{} block, you can simply
load the replacement backend via:
  /msg operserv modload ../backend/<replacement backend>

After the backend is loaded, you can export your data by using
OperServ's UPDATE command.

Once you have loaded the replacement backend, you are now on
SQL. You will probably want to switch your backend module out in
the configuration file, as your flatfile database will no longer
be updated. You may want to restart Services to ensure that the
transition was successful after updating the config file.

Switching from a SQL backend to flatfile can be done similarly.
