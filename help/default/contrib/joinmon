Help for JOINMON:

JOINMON allows you to maintain a list of glob patterns that match nicks of
users who will have their channel joins sent to the logchannel (under
the info loglevel).

These patterns are saved to the Atheme database and are kept between
services restarts.

Syntax: JOINMON ADD <pattern> [reason]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& JOINMON ADD jdhore1 some reason
    /msg &nick& JOINMON ADD jd* another reason
    /msg &nick& JOINMON ADD machineg?d imposter

JOINMON DEL allows you to remove entries from the list of currently
monitored user patterns.

Syntax: JOINMON DEL <pattern>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& JOINMON DEL jdhore1
    /msg &nick& JOINMON DEL machineg?d

JOINMON LIST allows you to list the currently monitored user patterns.

Syntax: JOINMON LIST

Examples:
    /msg &nick& JOINMON LIST
