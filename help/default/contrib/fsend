Help for FSEND:

FSEND allows you to forcibly send a memo to a nickname
that is offline at the moment.  When they come online 
they will be told they have messages waiting for them 
and will have an opportunity to read your memo.

Your memo cannot be more than 300 characters.

FSEND will override the target user having the NOMEMO
flag set and the target user having the source (you) on
memoserv ignore.

Syntax: FSEND <user|nick> text

Examples:
    /msg &nick& FSEND Kog pay your bills
