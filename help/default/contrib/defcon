Help for DEFCON:

DEFCON allows you to implement defense condition-based security on your network.
Use of this module is highly not recommended as it is a bad way to handle
network security and it has a very high possibility of annoying your users.

LEVELS:
    Levels define the amount of security that will be implemented.
    Each level builds on the level below it (3 has everything 4 has and more,
    as an example).

    1 - all connecting users are AKILLed for 15 minutes.
    2 - all users (except services opers) are ignored by services.
    3 - all channels are forced mode +R (by default).
    4 - no nick registrations allowed, no channel registrations allowed.
    5 - Normal network operation. No restrictions.


Syntax: DEFCON <level>

Example:
    /msg &nick& DEFCON 4
