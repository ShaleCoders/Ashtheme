Help for REQUEST:

REQUEST sending of an announcement. You must be identified
to a registered nick to issue this command. Please be
patient while your request is considered by network staff.

Note, you can only have 1 announcement pending at a time.
If you make a mistake, please CANCEL your current one and
re-request it, if you would like to submit a second one, please
wait until your first one is approved or denied.

Underscores ("_") in the subject will be replaced with spaces
automatically as you can not put spaces in the subject.
They will not be replaced in the rest of the announcement.

Syntax: REQUEST <subject> <announcement>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& REQUEST Some_Subject This is an announcement!
