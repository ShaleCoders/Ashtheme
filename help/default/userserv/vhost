Help for VHOST:

VHOST allows operators to set a virtual host (also
known as a spoof or cloak) on an account. This vhost
will be set on the user immediately and each time
they log in.

Syntax: VHOST <account> ON <vhost>
Syntax: VHOST <account> OFF

If the account is marked, you can override this
using the FORCE keyword.

Syntax: VHOST <account> ON <vhost> FORCE
Syntax: VHOST <account> OFF FORCE

Examples:
    /msg &nick& VHOST spb ON may.explode.on.impact
    /msg &nick& VHOST nenolod OFF
