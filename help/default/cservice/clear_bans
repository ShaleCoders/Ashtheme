Help for CLEAR BANS:

Clear bans will remove all bans found in a specific
channel. If your ircd supports other lists associated
with a channel (e.g. ban exceptions), you can clear
these by specifying the mode letters. Specify an
asterisk to clear all lists.

Syntax: CLEAR <#channel> BANS [types]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& CLEAR #support BANS

Clears #support ban list.

    /msg &nick& CLEAR #support BANS eI

Removes all ban and invite exceptions on #support
(if your ircd supports them).

    /msg &nick& CLEAR #support BANS *

Clears all lists of #support.

    /msg &nick& CLEAR #support BANS +

Shows the possible letters.
