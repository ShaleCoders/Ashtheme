Help for FREEZE:

FREEZE will "suspend" all users (Founder too), 
allowing the channel to continue to be used.
Users with flags or access to the channel are 
unable to use their access while frozen.
Channels cannot be dropped or transferred and
will continue to EXPIRE according to the normal
expiration policy set for channels.

Enabling FREEZE will immediately deop all ops
currently in the channel.

Use FREEZE OFF to un-suspend a channel.

Syntax: FREEZE <#channel> ON|OFF [reason]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& FREEZE #lamers ON spamming
    /msg &nick& FREEZE #teens OFF
